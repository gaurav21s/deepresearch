                                    - Brief overview of the topic area

                                    - Each section should focus on a sub-topic of the user-provided topic
                                    - Include any key concepts and definitions
                                    - Provide real-world examples or case studies where applicable

The report will be focused on the following topic:
{topic}

Your goal is to generate {number_of_queries} search queries that will help gather comprehensive information for planning the report sections.

The query should:
1. Be related to the topic
2. Help satisfy the requirements specified in the report organization

Make the query specific enough to find high-quality, relevant sources while covering the depth and breadth needed for the report structure.

Your goal is to generate the outline of the sections of the report.

The overall topic of the report is:
{topic}

The report should follow this organizational structure:
{report_organization}

You should reflect on this additional context information from web searches to plan the main sections of the report:
{search_context}

Now, generate the sections of the report. Each section should have the following fields:
- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web search for this section of the report or not.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Consider which sections require web search.
For example, introduction and conclusion will not require research because they will distill information from other parts of the report.

When generating {number_of_queries} search queries, ensure that they:
1. Cover different aspects of the topic (e.g., core features, real-world applications, technical architecture)
2. Include specific technical terms related to the topic
3. Target recent information by including year markers where relevant (e.g., "2024")
4. Look for comparisons or differentiators from similar technologies/approaches
5. Search for both official documentation and practical implementation examples

Your queries should be:
- Specific enough to avoid generic results
- Technical enough to capture detailed implementation information
- Diverse enough to cover all aspects of the section plan
- Focused on authoritative sources (documentation, technical blogs, academic papers)"""

SECTION_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are an expert technical writer crafting one specific section of a technical report.

Title for the section:
{section_title}

Topic for this section:
{section_topic}

Guidelines for writing:

1. Technical Accuracy:
- Include specific version numbers
- Reference concrete metrics/benchmarks
- Cite official documentation
- Use technical terminology precisely

2. Length and Style:
- Strict 150-200 word limit
- No marketing language
- Technical focus
- Write in simple, clear language do not use complex words unnecessarily
- Start with your most important insight in **bold**
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

3. Structure:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:
  * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)
  * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:
    - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
    - Use `1.` for ordered lists
    - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:
  * List each source with title, date, and URL
  * Format: `- Title : URL`

3. Writing Approach:
- Include at least one specific example or case study if available
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Focus on your single most important point

4. Use this source material obtained from web searches to help write the section:
{context}

5. Quality Checks:
- Format should be Markdown
- Exactly 150-200 words (excluding title and sources)
- Careful use of only ONE structural element (table or bullet list) and only if it helps clarify your point
- One specific example / case study if available
- Starts with bold insight
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Sources cited at end
- If there are special characters in the text, such as the dollar symbol,
  ensure they are escaped properly for correct rendering e.g $25.5 should become \$25.5

    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative reports:
    * Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report:

4. Quality Checks:
- For introduction: 50-100 word limit, # for report title, no structural elements, no sources section
- For conclusion: 100-150 word limit, ## for section title, only ONE structural element at most, no sources section
- Markdown format
- Do not include word count or any preamble in your response
